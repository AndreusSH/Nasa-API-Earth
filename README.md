# Nasa-API-Earth
Search earth pictures selecting longitude, latitude and date

My goal is to search for the aerial image of Earth, typing longitude, latitude and date

If I don't specify the field I just get the message: "You need to specify both latitude and longitude 
"

I also used a minimum of Responsive design so that I can change the size of the screen but the form still looks ok.

This is the Api I have been using for this project https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#earth
