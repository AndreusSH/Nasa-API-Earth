# Nasa-API-Earth
Search earth pictures selecting longitude, latitude and date

My goal is to search for the aerial image of Earth, typing longitude, latitude and date

If I don't specify the field I just get the message: "You need to specify all the data"

I also used a minimum of Responsive design so that I can change the size of the screen but the form still looks ok.

After you do your search, you will be redirected to another page with the image

This is the Api I have been using for this project https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#earth
